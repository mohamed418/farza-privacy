1. Your Account
Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate
information when you register for an account and we may use it and keep the information current.
This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about
changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make
informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints. You will be solely responsible and
liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account
information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure. You are responsible for maintaining
the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are
fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in
connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must
immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other
breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of
any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
2. Responsibility of Visitors and Users and traders.

photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our
Services by users or traders or anyone else and are not responsible for any use or effects of such
Content. So, for example: We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate,
useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical
inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity

submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties. If you post Content,
comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on
our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content
or your conduct. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase,
or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking
precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms,
Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The existence of a link to or from one of
our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website. When using these links, you
are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
3. Fees, Payment, and Renewal
a. Fees for Paid Services
Some of our Services are offered for a fee. By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified
fees associated with specific features. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees,
recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular
automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially or depending on sales), on
a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support
team. For revenue-based fees -- such as fees for Recurring Payments for your website’s subscriptions
-- you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates. Revenue-based fees are ongoing.
b. Payment
If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may
immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit
card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access
to our Services in general.
c. Fee Changes
We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free.
When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee
changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
d. Refunds
While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless
otherwise required by applicable law.

Please take the following sentences into consideration :
These lines explain our privacy policies, Our terms & conditions, Refund policy, Shipping policy.
We are only an intermediary between buyer and seller and are not responsible for products,
delivery, payment and collection
The service that we provide is that we bring merchants together with customers only, and we are
not responsible for any improper act by merchants or customers, as the experience and steps take
place as follows: Just
Merchants will display on our electronic market the products of the second round of household
electrical appliances, and those products are new household electrical appliances products that have
not been used before, but they have scratches, bruises, or bumps in their external body, and thus
their prices become lower than the known devices.
We are also not responsible for the data and information of customers, merchants, or any third
party we cooperate with. We only use it to create a personal account for the purpose of security and
privacy. We may use it or a third party may use it in analytics, marketing, promotion, or advertising.
Tracking the product delivery route, the customer's geographical location, and the location of the
merchants. We are not responsible for it, but the merchant and delivery companies are responsible
for them.
When paying electronically, your personal data and the data of the electronic payment card do not
reach us, we do not store them, and we do not deal with them, as they do not reach us in the first
place, so we are not responsible for that data.
When changing or updating the privacy policy, we will send a notice to all users and merchants, but
we are also not responsible if the notice does not reach one of them due to a technical malfunction
or anything like that, so from time to time check our privacy policy to see if there is any update.
To use our services, you must be over 18 years of age.
For merchants, we are not responsible for the customer in the event that he does not receive the
order or one of the products, and we are not responsible for the return policies, money back,
shipping price, and the product.
We are not responsible for the process of shipping the products. That process is the responsibility of
the merchant. Either he ships them himself, meaning his own cars, or through a shipping company.
By agreeing to these terms, you can take advantage of and use our services.
